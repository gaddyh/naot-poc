gemini_box_audit.py

Independent visual audit for a shoebox image.

The module does NOT treat Gemini as the authoritative barcode decoder.
It asks Gemini to:
- count physical shoeboxes;
- count visible product-barcode labels;
- identify boxes with missing/obscured/blurred labels;
- estimate distinct product-label groups;
- report scene-quality risks;
- optionally return approximate normalized bounding boxes.

Install:
    pip install google-genai pydantic

Environment:
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
    export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"   # optional

CLI:
    python gemini_box_audit.py /path/to/image.jpg

Import:
    from gemini_box_audit import audit_shoebox_image

    result = audit_shoebox_image("/path/to/image.jpg")
    print(result.model_dump_json(indent=2))

Act as an independent visual auditor for a system that converts photographs of
shoeboxes into draft ERP order lines.

Inspect the image carefully and assess the physical scene. Do not act as the
authoritative barcode decoder, and do not guess barcode digits.

Count and distinguish all of the following:

1. Distinct physical shoeboxes.
2. Physical shoebox product labels with a visible barcode region.
3. Product barcode labels that appear clear enough for a dedicated barcode
   decoder.
4. Boxes whose product barcode is not visible.
5. Product barcode regions that are obscured, blurred, or cropped.
6. Visually distinct product-label groups, using visible model/style, color,
   size, width, and label appearance. This is only a visual estimate and is
   not the number of decoded unique barcode values.
7. Possible non-product barcodes, such as shipping, logistics, warehouse,
   supplier, or carton barcodes.
8. Risks caused by overlap, reflections, duplicate views, perspective,
   low resolution, glare, or cropping.

Assign one observation to every distinct physical shoebox you can identify.
Use stable 1-based box indexes. When reasonably possible, include approximate
bounding boxes using normalized coordinates from 0 to 1000 in this order:
top, left, bottom, right.

Read human-visible model/style, color, size, and width text only when it is
actually legible. Never manufacture missing text. Do not return or infer
barcode numbers.

Set suitable_for_automatic_draft to true only when the visual scene appears to
show exactly one clear product-barcode label for every physical box and there
are no meaningful quality, overlap, duplicate-view, or non-product-barcode

    than ``audit_shoebox_counts`` because it returns spatial regions that can
    be matched to scanner detections.

    Gemini's normalized 0..1000 coordinates are resolution-independent, so they
